# Astro.v1

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/94048ce9-2abf-440a-bf8e-4ebf71d525f0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/astrov1/deploys)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                     | Action                                               |
